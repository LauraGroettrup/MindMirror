# MindMirror


MindMirror is a mental health app that trains you in getting aware of your emotions and dealing with them. It guides you 
through three steps:

  1) Detecting the emotion you are feeling at the moment
  2) Searching for the underlying conditions concerning that emotion
  3) Changing the present mood by finding possible actions that can change the mood, deciding for the
     best option and performing it (optional)
     
Users can decide between two paths - a conventional one (using words to express your emotion) and an intuitive one (using
pictures to express your emotion).


### Installation

At the moment there is no signed version for this apk. For tests you can build a debug apk.


### Usage

Do not use the app if your are suicidal or perform self-harming behaviour!
The use of the app is at one's own risk.


### Technologies/Built With

MindMirror is for Android only. It is built with Android Studio in Kotlin using Firebase as backend for authentication, 
storage and a nosql database (Firestore). Storage is used for saving pictures and the database is used for saving the 
sessions of the user. 


### Outlook

Future functions should analyze the session data to suggest the user actions that have helped him
in the past.
